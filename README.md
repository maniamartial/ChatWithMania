#ABOUT

The simple website implements a two chatting application, whereby one can send a message, 
other once responds.
They act similar to messaging application.
There are two users, the server(sending the text) and client, who receives the text.
So everyone is a server at the same time is a client.
Always create a room, the let the other users enter the specified name of the room. After the client has entered the room name, then send a message and it will pop up in the textfield.
